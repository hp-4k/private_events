# Private Events

This website is an exercise constituting a part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home), an open source curriculum for teaching web development. It is an independent project finishing the [associations](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/associations) chapter in the Ruby on Rails section of the course.
The website makes use of the following technologies:
+ Ruby on Rails backend, including <code>has_many</code> associations utilising join tables with custom foreign keys,</li>
+ unit and feature testing with RSpec, Capybara and supporting gems,
+ Bootstrap-powered front end,
+ a little bit of JQuery,
+ Heroku hosting.
